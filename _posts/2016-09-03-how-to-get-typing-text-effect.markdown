I'm working on a game right now, and in this game I want dialogue text from
talking to NPCs or reading signs to appear as if it is being typed. This is
a common effect which you might see in a game like Earthbound.

I am using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) for my game because it's an easy-to-use
framework with tons of community-authored libraries.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
